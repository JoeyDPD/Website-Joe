                Quickly got to grips with internal financial compliance process, handling my Senior Manager’s compliance also, often working to tight time constraints while having to ensure it’s right first time, every time.
            Establishing presence in a new sector.
            Becoming team “port of call” for industry info.
            Further establishing a presence not just for my self but for the company both via LinkedIn and reaching out to people in the space, networking and having regular conversations to build strong connections and use soft skills to ensure I was the first name that came to mind if they wanted new contract roles.

                I joined the business the month before finishing university, so managed a high workload while getting to understand this new sector, and over the next 6 months grew business revenues from circa £150,000 to £200,000 by sourcing individuals with a keen eye for detail, ensuring they would go on to be successfully placed. 
                I gained a varied industry knowledge rapidly, working across the UK, US and EU. The sectors I worked across varied from accountancy, SaaS, Care Homes and UK Rail Engineering. 
                I suggested the implementation of an Applicant Tracking System to the Managing Director. This freed up time for employees to focus on Business Development, and increasing revenues to exceed set targets, while increasing client satisfaction.When taking over from an employee on Maternity leave, I lead projects and managed large consultancy clients across the EU and became their go-to point of contact through rapport building and being highly responsive, both during work hours and out of regular hours.

                When starting in this role, I followed strict codes and guidelines to clean the clinic used in active drug testing, to ensure large first stage trials were able to go-ahead smoothly and keep patients comfortable.
                This role also allowed me to further skills in networking and being point of contact from patients taking part in trials, up to managing directors of the Clinic and quickly building a rapport through common ground.
